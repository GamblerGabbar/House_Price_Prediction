## Overview

Predicting house prices accurately is a critical challenge in the real estate domain. This project uses **TensorFlow Decision Forests**, a library designed to seamlessly integrate decision forests with the TensorFlow ecosystem, to train and evaluate models that predict house prices.

Decision forests combine the power of decision trees with ensemble learning techniques, making them suitable for structured data and tabular datasets.
